All the money we gather will be used in our server\u0027s billing.\\n- Main website is now public on Github, link added in the drawer.\n\\n- Now Offline button will be available when server is closed, there will be less chances of server closing.","donate_link":"https://paypal.me/amitoj02","donate_message":"It is happiest news that we have got more than 1500 users but have you ever felt server faults like you are unable to upload, view or download projects on Sketchub, this is because our app is at free plan. Holding such amount of users along with their project is heavier at free plan. Sometimes We have to close server in last week of every month because server bandwidth get exhausted.\n\nWe are also exhausting our storage because of such demand. Hence in upcoming days, when the server will be 100% full and if we wouldnâ€™t able to upgrade it, then we would need to reset the whole database to clear the space and users will lost the projects. For avoiding such problems, only few amount of money is needed to spent monthly (currently $2-$4). If you are willing We can accept appreciatable money through donation (Don\u0027t forget to check Terms and Conditions). Thanks for reading.","server_status":"true","message":"Connected","version":"24","java_link":"https://neonteam.net/api/sketchcode/codes/list.php"}
